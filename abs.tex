In today's world with the large amount of data present on the world wide web it is becoming a necessity to develop efficient Question Answering Systems. A Question Answer System should take queries from the user in natural language and return a short concise answer which best fits the response to the question. The report discusses the integration and implementation of Question Answer Systems for English and Hindi as part of the  open source search engine Yioop. Yioop is developed and managed by Dr. Christopher Pollett, San Jose State University.  A Question  Answer Sytem involves  many aspects related to Natural Language Processing.  The Information Retrieval module summarizes the text, which is then tagged for Parts of Speech. This tagged data is then used to create multiple question answer pairs which resemble the natural language format. The system is implemented so that it can distinguish the type of question being asked by the user, search the database or the index for the relevant information and then return the best answer to the user.
