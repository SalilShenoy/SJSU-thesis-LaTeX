A Question Answer System takes queries from the user in natural language and returns a short concise answer which best fits the response to the question. The report discusses the integration and implementation of Question Answer Systems for English and Hindi as part of the  open source search engine Yioop. We have implemented a Question Answer System for Hindi, keeping in mind users who use Hindi as their primary language. The user should be able to query a set of Hindi documents in Hindi and should get the answers in Hindi. English and Hindi are very different when it comes to language structure, characters etc. We have implemented a Brill Tagger variant for Part of Speech tagging of Hindi phrases and grammer rules for triplet extraction. We improve the existing lexical data by allowing the user to add Named Entities to the existing lexicon. We test the system by conducting experiments on an index of Hindi Wikipedia pages.
