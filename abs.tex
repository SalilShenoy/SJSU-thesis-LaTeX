A question answer system takes queries from the user in natural language and returns a short concise answer which best fits the response to the question. This report discusses the integration and implementation of question answer systems for English and Hindi as part of the  open source search engine Yioop. We have implemented a question answer system for English and Hindi, keeping in mind users who use these languages as their primary language. The user should be able to query a set of  documents and should get the answers in the same language. English and Hindi are very different when it comes to language structure, characters etc. We have implemented the Question Answer System so that it supports localization and improved Part of Speech tagging performance by storing the lexicon in the database instead of a file based lexicon. We have implemented a brill tagger variant for Part of Speech tagging of Hindi phrases and grammar rules for triplet extraction. We improve the existing lexical data by allowing the user to add named entities to the existing lexicon.The systems were then tevaluated for accuracy by comparing the retrieved answers against a dataset of answers known to be true.
