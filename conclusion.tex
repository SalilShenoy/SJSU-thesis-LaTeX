\chapter{Conclusion And Future Work}

\paragraph{}
As part of the project we improved the existing English Question Answer system in Yioop and integrated a Hindi Question Answer system in Yioop. The system uses a rule based approach for tagging and generating triplets for Hindi documents. The system handles simple questions asked by the user.

This project is one of the steps to improving and implementing a Open source Question Answer module for two languages English and Hindi respectively. These modules are able to answer simple Wh questions in both languages. We have performed some preliminary tests for these languages by creating separate indexes for English and Hindi. 

\paragraph{}
We have followed a rule based approach in implementing the Question Answer system, these can be improved going ahead with more knowledge about the languages. We can add more rules to the part of speech tagger and additional grammar rules to handle wide range of text.
