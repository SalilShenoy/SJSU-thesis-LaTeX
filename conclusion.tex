\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}
As part of the project we improved the existing english question answer system in Yioop and integrated a hindi question answer system in Yioop. The system uses a rule based approach for tagging and generating triplets for Hindi documents and storing them as part of the index. The system is able to handle simple questions asked by the user.

\paragraph{}
This project is one of the steps to improving and implementing a open source question answer module for two languages english and hindi respectively. These modules are able to answer simple \textit{Wh} questions in both languages. We have performed some preliminary tests for these languages by creating separate indexes for english and hindi. The systems were then evaluated by comparing the retrieved answers to a dataset of answers known to be true.

\paragraph{}
We have followed a rule based approach in implementing the question answer system. These can be improved going ahead by adding more rules to the part of speech tagger and additional grammar rules to handle wide range of text.
