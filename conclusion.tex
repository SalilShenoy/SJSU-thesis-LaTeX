\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}
As part of the project we improved the existing english question answer system in Yioop and integrated a hindi question answer system in Yioop. The system uses a rule based approach for tagging and generating triplets for Hindi documents and storing them as part of the index. The system is able to handle simple questions asked by the user.

\paragraph{}
This project is one of the steps to improving and implementing a open source question answer module for two languages english and Hindi respectively. These modules are able to answer simple \textit{Wh} questions in both languages. We have performed some preliminary tests for these languages by creating separate indexes for english and Hindi. The systems were then evaluated by comparing the retrieved answers to a dataset of answers known to be true.

\paragraph{}
Our systems for English and Hindi are open domain systems. We created a set of questions and answers which are know to be true. We then evaluated our system by asking it questions from the question set and comparing retrieved answers with the known answers in our dataset. Our system accuracy is observed to be 63\% for English and 55\% for Hindi. Using a rule based approach although faster has it limitation as implementing it requires knowledge about the language. Our system accuracy is caused by the fact that because sometimes the system may convert the user question to a triplet which is not part of the index or simple because the system was not able to extract information to answer related to the subject.

\paragraph{}
We have followed a rule based approach in implementing the question answer system. Our systems can be improved going ahead by adding improving the text parsing. We can improve the parsing of sentences extracted from the web page summary by identifying the named entities by modifying the part of speech tagging to use the entities added to the lexicon by the user.
