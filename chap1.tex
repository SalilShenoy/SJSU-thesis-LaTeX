\chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
The web has information written in almost 7000 languages and it is important to
have systems which can retrieve information effectively in different languages. The most researched Indian language is Hindi which means a relatively large number of Hindi documents are available. The purpose of implementing a question answer system which can accept and retrieve answers in Hindi is  to increase the access of Hindi speakers to more advanced information retrieval software. The users prefer and feel a sense of comfort if they can use a software, in a language they have expertise in. This is where Natural Language Processing \cite{chowdhury2003natural} plays an important role as it helps to handle information in native languages. I have implemented  a Hindi question answer system for Yioop which allows user to ask a question in Hindi and returns the answer also in Hindi. I developed a part of speech tagger and a triplet extractor to process Hindi text extracted by Yioop.

\paragraph{}
There are various Question Answering systems implemented over the years which extract data from the web and return answers. The systems implemented may use a knowledge store, machine learning or a combination of the two to process the data and extract question answers. We describe some of the related work and existing systems for Question Answering systems.

\paragraph{}
Question answer systems were developed with a view of extending research in natural language processing. One of the first question answer systems developed was STUDENT \cite{bobrow1964question}. This system was capable of solving high school algebra problems. Another example was LUNAR \cite{voorhees2000building} which was a system developed to answer questions related to moon rock data. LUNAR answer questions with an accuracy of 78\%. Hindi Language Interface to Database (HLIDB) \cite{dua2013hindi} is a knowledge based question answer system which takes input for user in Hindi and converts it to SQL and retrieves answers from the database.

\paragraph{}
In order to understand how effective a question answer system is, one
needs to establish a quantifiable means of testing question answers. One early such approach was taken by the developers of START, Question Answer System \cite{katz1997annotating}. START extracts data from the web to answer questions ranging from cities to people etc. The system uses a database to fetch the answer to a user asked question. START system was tested using some sample questions related to various domain, and most of them were answered. Results were precise and few of them were supported with images. Garima Nanda et al. implemented a Hindi Question Answer system, WebBasedQA \cite{nanda2016Hindi} using a combination of machine learning and a knowledge base to answer user queries. The system parses input, tokenizes and extract features using previously calculated results. The system uses  Naive Bayes as a classifier combined with known data store to return answers in Hindi. The system was  tested with two sets of questions, one set included questions asked by a user aware of the domain and another included questions asked by a user who was unaware about the domain. The results were 92\% and 88\% respectively. Information retrieval system for laws (IRSL)\cite {sangeetha2017information} is a closed domain Question Answer system developed for helping users get answers related to the Indian penal code. The system uses OpenNLP to preprocess the input and a Q-Learning algorithm to learn from user inputs and a Wordnet developed at Princeton University to extract synonyms. The system uses a set of words which identify the theme and a set of indexed keywords which are words in the laws. The system returns results based on the number of main and indexed keywords in the user query. The system improves evolves based on feedback from the user. The system was evaluated using precision score based on number of indexed keywords found in the user query. The accuracy of the system was found to be 79.19\%. 

\paragraph{}
The Question Answer Systems are mainly classified as Open Domain and Closed Domain Systems. 
Open domain systems are responsible for handling large amounts of data and wide range of questions. They are designed to answer questions about everything. Google, Wikipedia, etc. are examples of such systems. They depend on their knowledge store to tackle the questions and return the best answers.
Closed domain systems are designed to handle questions in a specific domain. For example, IRSL system is designed specifically to handle question-answers related to the Indian Judiciary. Such systems have a fixed set of documents which they process when a user asks a query to return the best answer.

\paragraph{}
The current work on Hindi information retrieval systems is limited to closed domain systems. These systems cannot be used by people from outside that domain. I have added an open domain Hindi Question Answer system to Yioop which answers simple questions asked in Hindi by retrieving answers also in Hindi, from the internet. 

\paragraph{}
Natural Language Processing is the core of any Question Answer system. The number of modules involved in building an efficient Question Answer system adds to the complexity of such a system. As part of the project, we have improved the performance of an existing Question Answering Module \cite {patel2015question} in Yioop. The work includes implementing a similar Question Answer system for Hindi which is an Indian language. In this report, we describe the the different steps we followed to build the system. The report is organized as follows: Chapter 2 gives a background on Question Answer Systems and describes the different approaches used in developing such systems, Chapter 3, describes the individual modules  like part of speech tagger, triplet extractor which were implemented to build the Hindi Question Answer System, and also a feature which allows users to add named entities to the Yioop database, Chapter 4, describes tests and experiments conducted on the Hindi Question Answer System, and a comparison of English and Hindi Question Answer systems in Yioop, Chapter 5 we give a short summary of the work done.
